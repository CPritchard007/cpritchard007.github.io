### Year 3 & 4 — Cross-Platform Developer, Internal LMS, Live Transit Mapping & V2xConnect

- Developed [V2xConnect](https://www.iteris.com/blog/iteris-launches-new-tool-connected-vehicle-applications), a mobile application used commercially and certified under OmniAir Qualified Test Equipment Status, enabling collection and playback of J2735 V2X communications gathered via Denso and Commsignia devices.
- Implemented a timeline-based “video-style” playback engine (pause, scrub, fast-forward, reverse, speed multiplier), converting raw network-style PCAPs into a human-readable chronological experience; improving vetting and analysis before ingestion into downstream systems.
- Built prototypes for unreleased LMS and live-transit mapping tools, including map-based playback, mobile capture flows, and UI interactions for training and operational review.
- Gained deep familiarity with J2735 automotive communication standards, ASN.1 message structures, and real-time interpretation of V2X signal streams.

### Year 2 — Front-End Developer, Vantage Argus
- Served as a primary engineer implementing the next-generation Vue-based client for a geospatial traffic analytics platform, modernizing a legacy application into a performant, map-centric reporting product.
- Optimized rendering of real-time speed and congestion data across large roadway networks by selectively loading/unloading geospatial segments, reducing map latency and preventing UI degradation with high marker volume.
- Implemented core data visualization components enabling intersection-level speed coloring, dynamic
filtering, and responsive scaling on Leaflet/Mapbox.
- Contributed to a platform now used by transportation agencies for faster reporting and analytics, improving workflow efficiency for internal and client-side users.

### Year 1 — Software Developer, Reward & Logo Apps
- Re-architected core application engine for multiple consumer-facing reward and playtime apps, transitioning from static, hard-coded behavior to a dynamic, server-driven configuration model.
- Enabled real-time toggling of core features (authentication providers, rewards, playtime bonuses, daily check-ins, account flagging) without requiring App Store updates, significantly increasing release agility and reducing operational downtime.
- Established a scalable white-label templating model, allowing new app variants to be produced using backend feature toggles and theme overrides rather than full-cycle builds, accelerating product delivery and reducing maintenance.
- Improved application resilience by ensuring failures in third-party login (e.g., Facebook/Google outages) did not invalidate user access or halt revenue flow.
- Example live apps: [Survey Pirate](https://www.surveypirate.app/), [Bounty Hunter](https://bountyhunterapp.co/)
